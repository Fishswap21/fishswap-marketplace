[build]
  publish = "public"
   issue is in your netlify.toml file! You created the function as `server.js`, but the redirects were still pointing to `api`. 

## ðŸ”§ **Quick Fix**

You need to update your **netlify.toml** file in GitHub to match the `server.js` function name:

```toml
[build]
  publish = "public"
  command = "echo 'Static deployment ready'"

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/api/*"
  to = "/.netlify/functions/server/:splat"
  status = 200

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200

[functions]
  directory = "netlify/functions"
